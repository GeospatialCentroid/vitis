# Wild *Vitis* of the Americas Conservation Assessment Effort

This project includes two primary data outputs: 1. county-level maps, and 2. modeled distributions, ecogeographic characterization, and conservation gap analysis results.
## [County-level maps](countyReports)

These reports are used to evaluate the current (01-2024) extent of the digital records available for native North American Vitis taxa. The presence of the taxon in a county along with the specific location of a record based on latitude and longitude values can be evaluated by experts for accuracy. The end goal is to develop, updated, accurate county-level distributions.

## [Modeled distributions, Ecogeographic Characterization, and Conservation Gap Analysis Results.](gapAnalysis)

These reports contain a series of maps, tables, and charts that summarize species distribution modeling, ecogeographic characterization, and conservation gap analysis results.
